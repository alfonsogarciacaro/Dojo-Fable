# Instructions

This code has been shamelessly lifted and slightly modified from 
the Fable samples at https://github.com/fable-compiler/Fable/tree/master/samples

1. Install node.js / npm: https://nodejs.org/en/
2. From this folder (Dojo-Fable/), run `npm install`
3. From the folder Dojo-Fable/canvas/, run `npm run build`
4. From the folder Dojo-Fable/canvas/, run `npm start`
5. You should now see a big square in your browser, generated from the Dojo-Fable/canvas/canvas.fsx code
6. Profit! Now let's make some more fancy stuff happen in canvas.fsx :)
